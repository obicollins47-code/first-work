<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a detail-oriented and highly adaptable learner with a strong interest in automation, digital workflows, and efficient system design. I enjoy working with tools such as n8n, Make.com, Automa, Google Sheets, Buffer, and various APIs, and I consistently look for ways to optimize tasks through automation and smart problem-solving.</p>

<p>My approach is analytical and solution-driven. I like breaking complex processes into clear, practical steps and refining them until they run smoothly. Whether I’m troubleshooting an error, structuring a workflow, or exploring new digital tools, I stay persistent and focused on achieving precise, reliable results.</p>

<p>I am continually expanding my technical understanding and developing the ability to build automation systems that are both effective and scalable. My goal is to keep improving my skill set and deliver systems that enhance productivity and streamline digital operations.</p>
